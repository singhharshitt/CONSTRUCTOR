# CONSTRUCTOR
<br>
<br>
<h2>1. DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR</h2>
<br>
<br>

<b>Example1. Create a Car class with attributes brand, model, and year. Implement a default constructor that initializes the brand to "Unknown", model to "Generic", and year to 2000. Write a method displayCarInfo() to print the car's details.<b>
<br>
<br>


<b>Example2. Define a Book class with attributes title, author, and price. Use a default constructor to initialize the title to "Untitled", author to "Unknown", and price to 0.0. Write a method showDetails() to print the book's information.</b>
<br>
<br>
<h2>2. PARAMETERIZED CONSTRUCTOR</h2>
<br>
<br>

<b>Example. Create a Student class with attributes name, age, and grade. Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize the name, age, and grade when a new Student object is created. Write a method displayStudentInfo() to print the student's details.</b>
<br>
<br>
Sample Input:
<br>
Name: John<br>
Age: 20<br>
Grade: A<br>
<br>
Sample Output:<br>
Name: John<br>
Age: 20<br>
Grade: A<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>3. COPY CONSTRUCTOR</h2>
<br>
<b>Example. Define a Rectangle class with attributes length and width. Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize the length and width and a method calculateArea() that returns the area. Additionally, implement a copy constructor to create a new Rectangle object by copying an existing one. Write a method displayArea() to print the area of the rectangle.</b>
<br>


<h2>4.CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING</h2>
<br>
<br>
<b>Design a class Box that represents a 3D box with attributes for its dimensions: length, width, and height. Your task is to implement constructor overloading to initialize the dimensions of the box in different ways.</b>
